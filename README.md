GitHub-clone is a web application built with React, TypeScript, RTK Query, and TailwindCSS. This application demonstrates the basic GitHub UI of user and repository pages using public GitHub API.

## Features

This application makes possible to search for any user on GitHub and look at his profile, stats, bio, and list of repositories. Moreover, it's possible to go to repository page and see it's description, list of used programming languages with percentage and repo contributors.

Also, you can manually change the color theme of the application, and itw will remain the same after page refresh since it utilizes localStorage to preserve this state.
